%% Dendritic tree initialization parameters

dend.basalBranches = 3; %roots branching directly from the soma
dend.basalDepth = 3; %maximum number of compartments away from soma
dend.basalDaughters = 2; %how many daughter branches at each branch point
dend.basalProb = [0.1 0.4 0.5]; %probability of number of branches at each branch point (should have length basalDaughters+1)

dend.apicalShaftCompartments = 5; %length of apical dendrite in compartments
dend.apicalDepth = 2; %maximum number of compartments away from main apical shaft
dend.apicalBranches = 2; %roots branching directly from each apical shaft compartment
dend.apicalDaughters = 2; %how many daughter branches at each branch point
dend.apicalProb = [0.7 0.25 0.05]; %probability of number of branches at each branch point (should have length apicalDaughters+1)

dend.tuftDepth = 5; %maximum number of compartments away from last apical shaft compartment
dend.tuftDaughters = 2; %how many daughter branches at each branch point

%changed this variable from [0.05 0.6 0.35] because the 5% chance of no
%apical shaft compartments threw error with runSimulation edges
dend.tuftProb = [0.00 0.6 0.4]; %probability of number of branches at each branch point (should have length tuftDaughters+1)

dend.spinesPerCompartment = 1; %number of spines connected to each compartment, except for the soma
dend.shaftConduct = 150; %conductance between shaft (and soma) compartments
dend.spineConduct = 25; %conductance between spine and shaft compartments
